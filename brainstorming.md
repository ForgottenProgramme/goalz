# Brainstorming Notes
 

TODO/Ideas:
Should "goals" be referenced as "goalz" at all places? That could be cool!
print errors/warnings in different color for visibility.

DONE:
At some point I could also display when the goal was completed.
All the goal names are capitalized before being added to the list.
Display completed goals in a table
Goals should be deletable 
Users should be able to start afresh
